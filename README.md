# Pause For Any Player

A Stardew Valley mod that pauses the game when any player is in a paused state, supporting both splitscreen and network multiplayer.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Universal Pause**: Game time stops when any player pauses (menu open, dialogue, etc.)
- **Splitscreen Support**: Works seamlessly with local splitscreen multiplayer
- **Network Multiplayer**: Syncs pause states across all connected players
- **Smart Host Control**: Only the host controls time in network games to prevent conflicts

### Energy Scaling
- **Configurable Energy Gains**: Adjust how much energy players gain from food/sleep
- **Default 25% Reduction**: Energy gains scaled to 75% by default (configurable)
- **Multiplayer Compatible**: Host controls energy scaling in network games

### Configuration
- **Generic Mod Config Menu Integration**: Easy in-game configuration
- **Energy Scale Factor**: Adjustable from 0.1x to 2.0x (default: 0.75x)
- **Host-Only Settings**: Configuration only available to host in network multiplayer

## Installation

1. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)
2. Download the latest release from [releases page]
3. Extract to your `Stardew Valley/Mods/` folder
4. Launch the game through SMAPI

## Dependencies

- **Required**: SMAPI 4.0.0+
- **Optional**: [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) for in-game configuration

## Configuration

### Via Generic Mod Config Menu (Recommended)
1. Install Generic Mod Config Menu
2. Open the game settings menu
3. Navigate to "Mod Options" â†’ "Pause For Any Player"
4. Adjust the Energy Scale Factor slider (0.1x - 2.0x)

### Manual Configuration
Edit `config.json` in the mod folder:
```json
{
  "EnergyScaleFactor": 0.75
}
```

## How It Works

### Splitscreen Multiplayer
- Monitors all local players' pause states
- Automatically pauses game time when any player has menus open or is in dialogue

### Network Multiplayer
- Each client sends their pause state to the host
- Host controls game time based on all connected players' states
- Pause states are synchronized when players connect/disconnect

### Energy Scaling
- Tracks energy changes for all players
- Applies scaling factor only to energy gains (not losses)
- Prevents energy exploitation while maintaining balance

- **Multiplayer**: Full support for both splitscreen and network multiplayer

## Technical Details

- Uses SMAPI's `requestingTimePause` to detect player pause states
- Implements message passing for network multiplayer synchronization
- Caches game time interval to restore proper timing after pause
- Tracks per-player energy states to prevent scaling conflicts
